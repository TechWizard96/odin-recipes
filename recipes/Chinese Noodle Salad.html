    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>I didn't like this the first few times I tried it but now I love it! It's got a tangy taste and goes well with Chinese food or sandwiches. Leftovers are softer but great as a snack the next day.</p>
    <h4>Recipe:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup rice vinegar</li>
        <li>¼ cup sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodles with seasoning packet</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a microwave-safe bowl, mix together vinegar, sugar, and oil. Microwave on high until sugar dissolves, about 1 minute. Mix well, and set aside to cool.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Crush ramen noodles in the packages. Pour into salad dressing.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In a salad bowl, toss romaine lettuce with oranges, almonds, and salad dressing.</li>
    </ol>
